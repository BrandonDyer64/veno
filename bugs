BUGS/TODO IN VENIC:

	- cannot CREATE new file with venic
	- text/cursor features missing:
		- cut/copy/paste
		- start/end of file
		- likely more
	- ctrl-c should ideally be a keybinding for something in the future, currently caught by main venic file try except
	- significant delay with operations with very fast consecutive key presses (pasting into terminal, scrolling with mouse)
		- check time since last key press in KeyBindings and determine action based on speed and key pressed
