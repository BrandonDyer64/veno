BUGS IN VENIC:

	- cannot CREATE new file with venic
	- cursor move right, at end of line, when off the screen, will result in the cursor going down, and the viewport just being shifted over one
	- text/cursor features missing:
		- pattern search
		- cut/copy/paste
		- start/end of file
		- likely more
	- ctrl-c should ideally be a keybinding for something in the future but is consistently caught by ncurses wrapper / getch()
